      <h2>Pinwheel Snap! Project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/index" >Snap!</a></li>
      <p>My goal was complete the pinwheel operation on UC Berkeley’s Snap! for Kaiser’s APCS class.To complete this, I looked through the BJC instructions and multiple attempts of testing and failure eventually leading to the correct set of blocks. Something challenging was persevering through when the operation was not working. I learned that block coding was a lot more than just the Hour of Code I did in fifth grade and the combination of the many blocks available can make truly amazing programs.</p>

      <h2>CMU Python Project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/" >CMU Python</a></li>
      <p>My goal was to learn stars and circles in Python drawing program. I followed the instructions given by CMU to match My Canvas to the solution. Some challenges included finding the nitty-gritty errors that were causing the Syntax errors. I learned Python can use simple shapes and patterns to create crisp and clean drawings.

      <h2>Biolympiad Diagrams</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.usabo-trc.org/" >Biology Olympiad</a></li>
      <p>My goal was to study for the Biology Olympiad by reviewing and drawing out diagrams and material in order to digest the material. I summarized diagrams learned in the textbook and draw it using my own creative brain and iPad software.One challenge was remembering the information once it is on paper. I learned the phylogeny of animals and the phylum chordata and study strategies for biology.
